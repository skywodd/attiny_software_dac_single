# Software DAC (single output version) library for Attiny 25 / 45 / 85
## by SkyWodd

This library is designed to create a software DAC with a fast PWM output.
A low-pass RC filter is needed on the PMW pin to smooth the PWM signal into a pseudo analog signal.

Ps: This version of the library only handle a single softDAC output.
A two output version is also available on my github.
